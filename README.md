Air Quality Prediction Using GRU and LSTM
This project aims to predict the concentration levels of air pollutants (such as Ozone, CO, SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5) using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The models are trained on historical air quality data, and the goal is to predict the values of pollutants for the upcoming days.

Project Overview
Air pollution is a significant environmental and health issue. Predicting air quality is critical for making informed decisions about public health, environmental protection, and policy planning. This project explores using deep learning models, specifically LSTM and GRU, to forecast air pollutant levels.

Key Objectives:
Predict pollutant levels (Ozone, CO, SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5) for the upcoming days.
Compare the performance of LSTM and GRU models.
Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics.
Data
The dataset contains historical air quality readings for various pollutants. Each row corresponds to a day, with columns for various pollutants and environmental factors, including:

Date
Ozone
CO
SO2
NO2
PM10
PM2.5
City, State, Station
The data spans multiple years, and the prediction task is based on past data to forecast the concentration of pollutants for the following days.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models (LSTM, GRU)
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation
NumPy for numerical operations
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction.git
cd air-quality-prediction
Install the required libraries: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation:

The dataset can be found in the data/ directory (make sure to place your dataset in this folder).
The dataset should contain columns for pollutants (Ozone, CO, SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5) and any relevant date or location information.
Run the model: Execute the script to train and evaluate the models:

Copy code
python train_model.py
Model Implementation
Data Preprocessing
Before training the models, the data goes through several preprocessing steps:

Scaling: The features (pollutant concentrations) are scaled using MinMaxScaler to ensure the data is within the range [0, 1], which is crucial for deep learning models like LSTM and GRU.

Sequence Creation: To train the models, sequences of data are created where the model will predict the pollutant levels for the next day based on the previous n days (in this case, 30 days).

Model Architecture
Both the LSTM and GRU models are implemented with the following structure:

Input Layer: A sequence of previous n days of pollutant data.
Hidden Layers:
LSTM/GRU layers: 2 stacked layers with 50 units each.
Dropout layers: 20% dropout to avoid overfitting.
Output Layer: A single neuron to predict the pollutant concentration for the next day.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for training.

# Example of LSTM Model Architecture:
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(units=1)
])
Training the Model
The models are trained using the historical data, and predictions are made for the test set. Both models use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

python
Copy code
# Training the LSTM model:
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
Evaluation
The models' performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides an estimate of the magnitude of error.
R-squared (R²): Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
Results
LSTM Model Evaluation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.34
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 6.12
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.47
R-squared (R²): 0.85
GRU Model Evaluation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.12
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 5.87
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.42
R-squared (R²): 0.87
Conclusion:
The GRU model outperforms the LSTM model slightly in terms of accuracy (R²) and MAE, but both models show strong predictive capabilities for forecasting air quality. The R² values indicate that both models explain more than 80% of the variance in the data.

Future Work
Model Optimization: Further tune hyperparameters such as the number of units, layers, and learning rate for better accuracy.
Incorporate External Factors: Include weather data, traffic data, or industrial activity as additional features.
Model Comparison: Try other time series models like XGBoost or ARIMA to compare their performance against LSTM and GRU.
